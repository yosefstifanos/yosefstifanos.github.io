## Welcome to my website! This README file is meant to document existing website that I've created. Every time I push an HTML file (fancy word for basically saying "adding words and cool stuff on a boring blank page") into my repo, I will update this homepage and link the current sites that are up. Originally this was a homework lesson for a course, but I decided to add my spin. If there are any errors or issues with any website that I have, please let me know via LinkedIn (@yosefstifanos) and I'll try to fix it ASAP! Enjoy the sites!
